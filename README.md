# Tokai Arboretum - v1
My original website using AngularJS for looking up the trees (name or number) of the Tokai Arboretum

I often went walking in the arboretum and there are many species of trees from all over the world.  They were planted in the 1800's to check for their viability for forestry in the South Africa.  All the tree have numbers on them and if you want to know what species it is then you have to remember the number and walk to the entrance (100's of meters) where they have a numbered list of the all the trees...hundreds of them.  Very user unfriendly.  So I took photos of the list and captured them manually into an array.  I then used Angular, which I was learning at the time, to display them and allow quick searching for either a name or a number.

I do plan on upgrading it in the following ways:
* Have a single search field (instead of 2)
* Add better responsiveness
* Add some aesthetic sugar to make it more pleaasing to the eye
* Add some UX features
